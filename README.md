# Welcome to GSON!

Use GSON to convert your Google sheet into a api. GSON simply converts your sheet to json and responds back the same, so no data is saved in backend.

# How to use it

The Base url is https://gson.fayazara.now.sh, append your sheet/csv url as a query parameter like this https://gson.fayazara.now.sh?url={{Your Sheet Url here}}
